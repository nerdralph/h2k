                <ceilings>The Canada Greener Homes Grant initiative offers grants of up to $1,800 for increasing home insulation in attics, cathedral ceilings and flat roofs. The amount you are eligible for will depend on factors such as what insulation is currently in your home, how much insulation you add and the type of attic/ceiling your home has. Insulation slows the rate of heat loss, resulting in improved energy use and reduced energy costs. Installing insulation in an attic, cathedral ceiling or flat roof is eligible for a grant, as long as minimum levels of insulation and coverage are achieved. If your house consists of more than one roof or roof type, the grant amount will be pro-rated and calculated based on roof type and area. It is recommended that you take work-in-progress photos to document retrofits that cannot be visually verified by the energy advisor, such as insulation in a cathedral ceiling.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; The insulation in your attic was assessed at R-__. Because the amount of insulation in your attic has been assessed as greater than R-12 but less than or equal to R25,  a grant of up to $1800 is available for adding insulation to reach R-50 or more.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Keeping the heat in - section 5 has valuable information that could be of interest to you: https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy-efficiency/homes/make-your-home-more-energy-efficient/keeping-the-heat/chapter-5-roofs-and-attics/15637 </ceilings>
                <exposedFloors>Through the Canada Greener Homes Grant initiative, a grant of $350 is available for adding insulation to exposed floors. The exposed floor area must be a minimum of 11 square meters (120 square feet) and may be composed of either one large exposed floor area or multiple smaller areas. Each section of exposed floor area must be entirely insulated with a minimum additional insulation level of RSI 3.52 (R-20). Insulating exposed floors may result in energy savings and improve comfort in rooms above exposed floors. It is recommended that you take work-in-progress photos to document retrofits that cannot be visually verified by the energy advisor, such as insulation covered by drywall.</exposedFloors>
                <foundation>The Canada Greener Homes Initiative offers grants of up to $1,500 for adding insulation to basement walls. Insulating basement walls can reduce energy costs and improve comfort. Grants are based on the RSI/R-value of the added insulation and the percentage of wall area insulated. The current amount of insulation does not affect the grant amounts. A minimum of 20% of the exterior foundation wall area must be insulated.  It is recommended that you take work-in-progress photos to document retrofits that cannot be visually verified by the energy advisor, such as insulation installed from the outside.</foundation>

                <HeatingSystem>Through the Canada Greener Homes initiative, a grant between $2,500 and $5,000 is available for installing a new cold climate air source heat pump system. The grant amount is based on the type and configuration of the heat pump system: $2,500 is available for mini- or multi-split systems with two indoor heads or warm air supply outlets and $5,000 is available for cold climate air source heat pump central systems or mini- or multi-split systems with a minimum of three indoor heads or warm air supply outlets.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; The installation must include all components of the heat pump system. For mini- or multi-split systems, this means both the outdoor and indoor units. For central systems, this means the outdoor and indoor units, as well as the furnace or air handler that is listed as part of the heat pump system (unless that furnace is already in the home, in which case it can be kept). The exception to this is "Coils Only" systems that can be paired with any existing furnace.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;The Canada Greener Homes initiative requires that the heat pump system is capable of distributing heat throughout the entire conditioned space in the home, including the basements where the height is 1.8 m (5 ft. 11 in.) or higher. A minimum of one indoor head or warm air supply outlet is required on every floor, including a mezzanine that has a room with a door, of each dwelling unit in the building.  In the case of a split-level home, one indoor head or warm air supply outlet is required on the uppermost floor, and one per pair of split levels. More than one indoor head and/or warm air supply outlet per floor may be required to ensure heat distribution throughout the entire building.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;To determine the eligibility of the product you are seeking to purchase, use the AHRI number and make and model of the indoor and outdoor units provided by the mechanical system contractor to confirm that it is included on the Searchable product list of eligible heat pumps for the Canada Greener Homes initiative.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;https://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/pml-lmp/index.cfm?language_langue=en&amp;action=app.search-recherche&amp;appliance=ASHP2_GH&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A; A mechanical system contractor can advise on whether a heat pump is the right choice for your circumstances. The contractor is responsible for specifying (including load calculations, sizing and selection) and installing the new system to meet all requirements. It is highly recommended to obtain two signed attestation forms from your contractor confirming that the heat pump has been installed by a trained and licensed professional certified in your province or territory, and that it is capable of distributing heat throughout the entire conditioned space in the home. The attestation forms are available on the Canada Greener Homes website.&#x0D;&#x0A;&#x0D;&#x0A;Natural Resources Canada has developed a package of materials related to air source heat pump sizing and selection, intended for use by mechanical system designers and renovation contractors:&#x0D;&#x0A; https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/maps-tools-and-publications/tools/modelling-tools/toolkit-for-air-source-heat-pump-sizing-and-selection/23558&#x0D;&#x0A;</HeatingSystem>
                <Renewables>Through the Canada Greener Homes initiative, a grant of $1,000 per kW DC is available for installing a solar photovoltaic (PV) system. If you choose to install a PV system, it is strongly recommended that a full assessment by a professional solar PV installer, including an estimate of solar insolation (how much sunlight falls on the roof) is undertaken to provide detailed information on considerations for your home and specific installation recommendations, including the size and related energy production of the system.  The PV panels must have a rated peak power capacity higher than or equal to 1.0 kW DC. The system must be composed of PV panels certified to CSA Standards and, if required, of inverters certified to CSA Standards. Solar panels can be mounted on the house or ground, as long as they are on the property / land of the house associated with the application. Building permits may be required for both off-grid and grid-connected installations. For a grid connected system, a copy of the letter of approval or permission for interconnection issued by the local electrical or building authority is required. For more information, refer to Natural Resources Canada’s Solar Ready Guidelines.</Renewables>
